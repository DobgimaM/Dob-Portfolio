## Data Analysis
### Project 1: [Database of practices in Wales](https://github.com/DobgimaM/Wales-database)
*Languages:* R, SQL

**Description**
This project designs a software using publicly available datasets of different counties in Wales to report epidemiological information 

![](https://github.com/DobgimaM/Wales-database/blob/main/Hypertension%20rate%20in%20a%20selected%20practice%20in%20Dyfed.png)

Datasets used for the software include:

• [General Practice Prescribing Data Extract for Wales](http://www.primarycareservices.wales.nhs.uk/general-practice-prescribing-dataextrac)
 
• [QOF Results for Wales, 2015](https://www.gpcontract.co.uk/browse/WAL/15)

This program allows a non-technical user to

1. See a table comparing the different counties in Wales, which has the following
columns: county name, number of GP practices, number of GP practices with medication data
available, number of GP practices with QOF data available, total number of registered patients,
average spend on medications per month.

2. List the practices within the selected county and indicate whether each
one has QOF data and medication data.

3. Select one practice within that county. Visualize the rate of hypertension at
each practice within the county, highlighting the selected practice also showing the average rate
for Wales as a comparison.

4. Perform an all-Wales analysis comparing the rate of hypertension and the rate of insulin
prescribing at a practice level, checking for any statistical relationships between the two.

### Project 2: [Analysis for "Ethnic variation in asthma phenotypic presentation and outcomes: a cross-sectional analysis of the UK biobank" paper](https://github.com/DobgimaM/Data-analysis-for-respiratory-health-data)

*Language:* R

**Fig: Scatterplot of z-scores and median z-scores (solid lines) of forced expiratory volume in 1s (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC) and FEV1/FVC in males and females by age, height and study site. Dashed lines represent the 5th and 95th centiles**

**Description**
This is work extends the analysis for a [published paper](https://thorax.bmj.com/content/early/2023/12/07/thorax-2023-221101) examining ethnic disparities within asthma care in the UK.
- It explores demographic and clinical characteristics of doctor-diagnosed asthma participants by self-reported ethnicity and country of birth within the UK Biobank.
- ggplot2 graphs were used to illustrate the deviation of Ethnicity-adjusted equations from the Global Lung Initiative using properties of the Standard Normal Distribution.

### Project 3: Road traffic crashes in Bradford

*Language:* R

Insights into road traffic crashes in Bradford using road traffic crash data for the Bradford Council area for the years 2018-2020 from [DfT data](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/road-accidents-and-safety-statistics-notes-and-definitions/reported-road-casualties-in-great-britain-notes-definitions-symbols-and-conventions)

<img src="https://github.com/DobgimaM/Road-accidents-in-Bradford/blob/main/Casualty%20and%20accident%20rates.png" width="500" />

**Description**

This project explores Road traffic accidents in Bradford looking at
- Descriptives
- Accident age groups with over 200 casualties
- Weather and road surface conditions for age groups with over 200 casualties

### Project 4: [Machine Learning techniques to develop an algorithm that predicts admissions to a hospital's emergency department.](https://www.kaggle.com/code/blakptico/group-8-ed-dataset) 
*Language:* Python

**Description**
A Kaggle-based project to predict accident and emergency admission on synthetic data

<img src="https://github.com/DobgimaM/Dob_portfolio/blob/main/Feature%20selection.png" width="500" />

This project uses Logistic Regression with Ridge Regularization, Decision Trees, Random Forest using GridCV, XGBoost, K-Nearest Neighbours and Deep Neural Network to develop a predictive model for hospital admissions
