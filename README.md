## Project 1: [Database of practices in Wales](https://github.com/DobgimaM/Wales-database)
*Languages:* R, SQL

- Software using publicly available datasets of different counties in Wales to report epidemiological information 

Datasets used for the software include:

• [General Practice Prescribing Data Extract for Wales](http://www.primarycareservices.wales.nhs.uk/general-practice-prescribing-dataextrac)
 
• [QOF Results for Wales, 2015](https://www.gpcontract.co.uk/browse/WAL/15)

**Description**
A program that allows a non-technical user to

1. See a table comparing the different counties in Wales, which has the following
columns: county name, number of GP practices, number of GP practices with medication data
available, number of GP practices with QOF data available, total number of registered patients,
average spend on medications per month.

2. List the practices within the selected county and indicate whether each
one has QOF data and medication data.

3. Select one practice within that county. Visualize the rate of hypertension at
each practice within the county, highlighting the selected practice also showing the average rate
for Wales as a comparison.

4. Perform an all-Wales analysis comparing the rate of hypertension and the rate of insulin
prescribing at a practice level, checking for any statistical relationships between the two.




## Project 2: [Data analysis for "Ethnic variation in asthma phenotypic presentation and outcomes: a cross-sectional analysis of the UK biobank" paper](https://github.com/DobgimaM/Data-analysis-for-respiratory-health-data)

This is work replicates the original data analysis for a [published paper](https://thorax.bmj.com/content/early/2023/12/07/thorax-2023-221101) examining ethnic disparities within asthma care in the UK.

**Description**
- It explores demographic and clinical characteristics of doctor-diagnosed asthma participants by self-reported ethnicity and country of birth within the UK Biobank.
- ggplot2 graphs were used to illustrate the deviation of Ethnicity-adjusted equations from the Global Lung Initiative using properties of the Standard Normal Distribution.
